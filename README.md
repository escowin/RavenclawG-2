# Raven Home

This website showcases skills learned during weeks 1-6 of The Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin. HTML, CSS, and Javascript were used to provide function to the website.
The website is intended to be a browser homepage providing useful information that is used daily.

## How Raven Home is Used
Upon first load the user is presented with the settings area. Here they may dictate which widgets they desire to be on their home page. Other fields include the user's name and their preference of dark or light mode. Once preferences have been set and the update button is clicked the user is presented with their new home page, complete with daily info. User settings may be altered by clickeing "Update Settings" at the bottom of the page.

## Failsafes
The settings tab runs checks to make sure the user has specified their name, dark/light mode, and the city for their weather.
